He also won two silver medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 200- and 400-meter freestyle. He is the first Asian swimmer to claim a gold medal in the men's 400-meter freestyle, and the first-ever South Korean swimmer to win any Olympic medal in swimming. He also holds 3 Asian Records, all in Men's Freestyle. He is best known for his impressive range and versatility, as he is able to compete at international level in 100-, 200-, 400- and 1,500-meter freestyle.

Early and personal life

On September 27, 1989, Park was born in Seoul, South Korea to a middle-class family. His father is a saxophone player and his mother is a dancer. He has an elder sister Park In-mi.[5]

Park started swimming at the age of 5. He idolizes Ian Thorpe as his role model.[6][7]

Park is an alumnus of Kyunggi High School and Dankook University. He graduated from Dankook University in February 2012,[8] where he majored in Physical Education.

In 2012, Park released an autobiography 박태환 : Freestyle Hero.[9]

Park met his first love when they were in Dankook University. The couple split in 2010.[10][11]

He currently serves as a goodwill ambassador for 'Dynamic Korea', South Korea's international image-making campaign, alongside international figure skater Yuna Kim.[12] Park Tae-hwan is one of Asia's top men's freestyle swimmers. He was voted Most Valuable Player at the 2006 Asian Games in Qatar where he won seven medals including three gold. He was voted Swimming World's Pacific Rim Swimmer of the Year in 2006.

Park, as an Olympic and Asian Games medalist, was granted an exemption from two years of mandatory military service. However, he was still required to undergo four weeks of basic training, which he reported for on October 4, 2012.[13]

Difficulties
Financial crisis

Park has allegedly faced many financial difficulties, despite being a world-class athlete. SK Telecom had sponsored Park from 2007 to 2012 but when his contract expired in 2012, SK Telecom decided to discontinue their sponsorship. Park was left to support his own athletic career for half a year. In the same year, Korea Swimming Federation (KSF) refused to give Park his 50 million won (approximately $44,950 USD) for winning two silver medals in the London Olympics. He received this award money in 2014. In 2013, it was revealed that Park did not have a swimming pool to train in. Within Seoul, there were only 7 swimming pools with a 50-meter lane, the international standard. These pools were either all booked or did not fulfill basic conditions like the water temperature which made it impossible to train in. In March 2013, Park signed with the Incheon Metropolitan City's swimming team. Park has since been receiving an annual salary from the city. In the sport centre of Incheon City, the swimming arena is named as Park Tae-hwan Aquatics Center (문학박태환수영장) in honor to Park's unique achievement.[14][15][16]

Doping
He was hit by a steroid scandal as prosecutors confirmed on January 27, 2015 that he tested positive in a doping test. His doctor (who later claimed unfamiliarity with the regulations) had administered Nebido - a relatively new anabolic steroid.[17] In mid-Aug, 2016, Seoul Central District Court of final appeal ruled the doctor who injected Park with the steroid Nebido guilty of breaching medical code for failing to log into her patient's records, but cleared of the more serious charge of causing Park bodily harm. The doctor was fined $10,000 for the incident which resulted in an 18-month ban by FINA for Park, thus ruling the former Olympic champion out of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[18][19]

In October 2016, as the 2016 South Korean political scandal broke out, it was revealed that Park and his doping woes were caused by the corruption within South Korea's Ministry of Culture and Sports, thus rendering him a victim.[20][21][22][23][24][25][26] With Kim Jong, the former Vice Minister of Culture and Sports, issued an apology to him.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]

Swimming
Beginning

Park began swimming at the age of 5 when his doctor suggested it would be good for his asthma. He began his competitive swimming career at the age of 7, earning several medals in junior competitions.[35] This early success led to Park's selection to the Korean Swimming Federation as a national team member in 2003.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was his first international competition, 14-year-old Park was the youngest athlete of Team South Korea.[36] However, Park was disqualified for a false start in the preliminary heat of the men's 400-meter freestyle.[37] Park later confessed that his disappointment over this fueled him to improve his starts, and he now has one of the fastest reaction times among top elite swimmers, consistently posting under 0.70 of a second. Shortly thereafter at the 2004 FINA Swimming World Cup, Park was the runner-up in the men's 400-meter freestyle event.

During the 400-meter qualifying heat race, Park was initially disqualified for a false start, which was wrongfully called. Shortly after the South Korean Federation met with the FINA bureau the ruling was overturned and Park was reinstated into the race. FINA was unable to explain why the judge on the pool deck called it a false start, and a FINA official called the wrong call as a "human error maybe".[43] He won silver in the finals of the 400-meter race.[44]

In the 200-meter freestyle, Park managed to repeat his silver medal from Beijing by tying China's Sun Yang with a matching time of 1:44.93.[45][46][47][48]

In his third and final event, 1500-meter freestyle, Park posted a South Korean record of 14:50.61, but missed the podium by a 10.3-second margin behind defending Olympic champion Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia.[49]

Not only is Park the first to win the title three straight times with titles in 2006 and 2010, he's also the first three-time winner period.

Park, a national icon who remains the only South Korean with an Olympic swimming gold, had previously argued that a Seoul-based doctor named Kim had given him an injection without fully disclosing that it could contain a banned substance. The doctor was later indicted on charges of professional negligence and will stand trial next month. FINA later suspended Park, and deleted all of his results after September 3 from the records.

The suspension cost Park six medals he captured at the Incheon Asian Games, where the swimming races were held at an arena bearing Park's name. Since three of those medals came in relays, Park's teammates in those races will also lose their medals.[51]

2016 Summer Olympics

In July 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Park would be eligible for the Olympics, after the Korean Olympic Committee had intended to ban Park from representing the national team after his doping ban ended. That doping ban, following a positive test for testosterone in 2014, had ended several months before the Olympics.[52][53]

In Rio 2016, Park had a poor meet due to the insufficient training. In the heats of 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in men's freestyle, Park failed to qualify for the next rounds. He withdrew in the men's 1500 m, his final event. Park stated that he would continue his swimming career.[54][55][56][57]

2016 South Korean National Sports Festival
In October 2016, Park attended South Korean National Sports Festival. At this domestic sports festival, Park won two gold medals. His winning time of 1:45.01 in the 200 m freestyle made him the second fastest man in 2016 worldwide, only behind Sun Yang whose time is 1:44:65.[58] One day later, his winning time of 3:43.68 in the 400 m freestyle was also one of the fastest in this distance in 2016 worldwide.[59][60] His times were significantly faster than those at the Olympic two months before.[61]

2016 Asian Swimming Championships
In 10th Asian Swimming Championships in Japan, Park won 5 medals, included 4 gold medals in singles and 1 bronze medal in relay.[62][63][64][65] His performance in the Men's 200m freestyle set a new record of Asian Swimming Championships in history.[66]
